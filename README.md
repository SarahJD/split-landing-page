# Split Landing Page

This is a split landing page. When you hover over one part of the site, it takes 75% of the space, if you hover over the other part the ratio turns around.

It is quite CSS heavy with a little bit of JavaScript for the hover effects.

This landing page is based on the 8th project from Brad Traversy's Udemy Course "50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript".
